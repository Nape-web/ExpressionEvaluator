# Algebraic Expression Evaluator
This project is a coding program that evaluate algebraic expressions and prints the results. It uses the concept of re.match funcstions
and deploys recursive parsing to manipulate arthimetic operators and operands to evaluate the user's elgebraic expression input and therafter 
print out the results.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
In order to rund this program,you wii need to have Python 3.7 installed.
### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine 
'''
git clone https://github.com/Nape-web/ExpressionEvaluator.git
'''
### Running the program
To run the program,simply navigate to the directory where the program was cloned and type the following command:
'''
python3
ExpressionEvaluator.py
'''
The program will then promt you to input an algebraic expression.
